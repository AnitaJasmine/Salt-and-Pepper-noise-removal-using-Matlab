# Salt-and-Pepper-noise-removal-using-Matlab
ROAD(Rank Ordered Absolute Difference) Technique is used to remove the Salt and Pepper Noise in Grayscale Images. This Gui based software will help to understand the impulse noise and efficacy of ROAD in 3X3 window yielding PSNR of 34.13 for 50% Noise 
This method is implemented using Matlab 7.5 and executed in the core2 duo processor 2.40GHz,0.98 GB RAM. This software works in version Matlab R2021a
